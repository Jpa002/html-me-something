<h2>Camping &amp Hiking:</h2>
    <body>
    I love camping and hiking. Although I dream of one day doing the famed Appalachian trail. Right now I only can do shorter but still challenging weekend hikes in my home state of Arkansas. 
    The first overnight backpacking trip I have done is the Butterfield at Devil's Den State Park. It is an overnight 15 mile loop, although I have day hiked the whole thing a couple of times. The first time 
    I attempted it, it was the hardest thing I have ever done. I was so sore afterwards I couldn't walk up my stairs when I got back to my house. Here is a link to more information about the trail:

    Another trail I have done is a lot longer. It is the 27 mile Eagle Rock Loop in the Ouachita Mountains. It is a much more challenging trail but I have been able to complete it in two days. My first trip was with my friend 
    and we ended up having to take a shortcut through a road in order to avoid getting rained on. However on my second attempt we were able to do the full 27 miles. A great aspect of overnight hiking trips is getting to camp 
    when the hiking for the day is over. I often go camping just to camp, but throwing an exhausting hike in before making camp makes the trip that much more rewarding.<br>

<h2>Hunting:</h2>
    Hunting is another favorite hobby of mine, a few times I went deer hunting with my family when I was growing up. However after my wife's family invited me to go duck hunting five years ago I have liked duck hunting better. The big difference between the two 
    is when you are duck hunting you are allowed to talk until the ducks come flying in. When you are deer hunting you have to be really quite the entire time.Hunting is fun because there is something special 
    about waking up and early and watching the world come to life. The best part of hunting is just getting out in nature and spending time with friends and family.<br>
